2015-07-11 10:47:22	mst	[09:58:43] also DateTime::Format::Human::Duration
2015-07-11 10:47:22	mst	[09:58:51] neither's quite perfect but should give you some ideas

2015-07-11 10:47:22	Craftsmanship	[10:05:58] I can't imagine using them otherwise
2015-07-11 10:47:22	smls	[10:07:03] Well, readline is usually used by itself in the form   while (<$fh>) { ... }
2015-07-11 10:47:22	Craftsmanship	[10:08:55] DateTime::Format::Human::Duration seems like a good start
2015-07-11 10:47:22	Craftsmanship	[10:09:10] I'm sure i can make it more vague
2015-07-11 10:47:22	mst	[10:10:47] Craftsmanship: if unsure if you've succeeded, test it against http://trout.me.uk/caption.jpg

2015-07-11 10:47:22	Grinnz	[10:14:32] mst, the issue with Getopt::Long in perlbrew is not because it's missing, it's because the perlbrew bootstrap script does not load vendorarchlib or something and this bug has been open for like a year
2015-07-11 10:47:22	Grinnz	[10:14:50] the solution is download perlbrew.pl and add the right libs to what it loads

2015-07-11 10:47:22	mst	[10:16:40] it was already 5.16
2015-07-11 10:47:22	mst	[10:16:49] at that point, fuck teaching a newbie how to upgrade
2015-07-11 10:47:22	Grinnz	[10:16:52] yeah, he had other issues
2015-07-11 10:47:22	Grinnz	[10:17:11] i'm just saying for future reference, if you see the Getopt::Long or Cwd problem with perlbrew and it's a redhat system :P

2015-07-11 13:07:42	Nomenclatura	[12:11:35] gotta be better at perl, it often saves my butt
2015-07-11 13:07:42	anno	[12:14:39] vec($new, 2*$_, 1) = vec($bin1, $_, 1); vec($new, 2*$_ + 1, 1) = vec($bin2, $_, 1) for 0 .. 8*length $bin1;
2015-07-11 13:07:42	anno	[12:15:14] well, not quite like that, but use vec() to interleave the bits
2015-07-11 13:07:42	pink_mist	[12:15:34] something like: use List::MoreUtils 'zip'; print C zip @{[ split //, <A> ]}, @{[ split //, <B> ]}; where A, B, and C are filehandles to the files you want to read from and write to
2015-07-11 13:07:42	fALSO	[12:15:41] Hi anyone willing to help me with perl arrays/hashes ? im trying to make this work : https://ideone.com/aneOiS

2015-07-11 13:07:42	rindolf	[12:27:32] Nomenclatura: you can speed up the operation by creating a lookup table from two octets to one 16-bit word.
