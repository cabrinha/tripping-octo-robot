2015-07-11 13:07:42	phibs	[12:11:11] IPA?
2015-07-11 13:07:42	MerlinTHP	[12:16:56] IPA uses 389-DS, not openldap.
2015-07-11 13:07:42	MerlinTHP	[12:17:03] Might well still be the right answer, though.
2015-07-11 13:07:42	phibs	[12:19:23] ah yes my bad
2015-07-11 13:07:42	phibs	[12:19:45] wonder how ApacheDS fairs
2015-07-11 13:07:42	xmj	[12:31:38] FreeIPA, yea
2015-07-11 13:07:42	xmj	[12:31:45] I thought FreeIPA was using openldap :)
