2015-07-11 10:47:22	pgas	[09:39:22] isomorphismes: yes, I also saw that bash is doing the right thing, hence your ls command is broken
2015-07-11 10:47:22	isomorphismes	[09:39:29] how do I unset -x ?
2015-07-11 10:47:22	pgas	[09:39:30] !pe > cupantae
2015-07-11 10:47:22	greybot	[09:39:30] cupantae: Parameter Expansion expands parameters: "$foo", "$1". You can use it to perform string or array operations: "${file%.mp3}", "${0##*/}", "${files[@]: -4}". They should *always* be quoted. See: http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/073 and "Parameter Expansion" in man bash. Also see http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/syntax/pe.
2015-07-11 10:47:22	pgas	[09:39:36] isomorphismes: set +x
2015-07-11 10:47:22	isomorphismes	[09:39:43] thanks
2015-07-11 10:47:22	isomorphismes	[09:40:43] can I somehow echo *log | xargs cat | grep ?
2015-07-11 10:47:22	pgas	[09:40:43] that doesn't explain your initial grep example though was that a fake?
2015-07-11 10:47:22	isomorphismes	[09:40:57] pgas: nope all real
2015-07-11 10:47:22	isomorphismes	[09:41:09] I kinda think it's at the glob expansion level not ls itself
2015-07-11 10:47:22	isomorphismes	[09:41:10] whatever's wrong
2015-07-11 10:47:22	cupantae	[09:41:20] pgas: thanks again. TBH, I might leave those tabs open and do it the bad way for now. :P the script only has to be run once. it's ok if it's slow.
2015-07-11 10:47:22	pgas	[09:41:29] isomorphismes: nope in the trace you see that the glob expansion is fine
2015-07-11 10:47:22	isomorphismes	[09:41:33] also of course when I asked on superuser or unix.SE they weren't going to believe "my ls is broken"
2015-07-11 10:47:22	pgas	[09:41:43] isomorphismes: and in your first grep... there is no expansion
2015-07-11 10:47:22	pgas	[09:42:05] this one: grep -E 'pqr.png' "*Rhist"

2015-07-11 10:47:22	pgas	[09:43:23] I have a hard time believing your ls is broken and your grep is parsing globs itself
2015-07-11 10:47:22	pgas	[09:43:37] isomorphismes: yes....xargs is broken for this, that is not news

2015-07-11 10:47:22	pgas	[09:46:58] isomorphismes: can you do: declare -fp ls
2015-07-11 10:47:22	pgas	[09:47:42] # ls () { echo foo; };alias ls='ls --color-auto'; set -x; ls *

2015-07-11 10:47:22	cupantae	[09:54:17] by the way, i have also found that if you do something like "$(echo " , bash expects the closing second quote FIRST, THEN the ) and THEN the closing first quote.
2015-07-11 10:47:22	cupantae	[09:55:13] in other words, it doesn't entertain the notion of x="$(thing " . It just asks for more input.
2015-07-11 10:47:22	cupantae	[09:55:31] and this is good.
2015-07-11 10:47:22	isomorphismes	[09:56:59] I have problems with mv and cp too fwiw
2015-07-11 10:47:22	pgas	[10:05:06] isomorphismes: declare not found means you are not using bash
2015-07-11 10:47:22	pgas	[10:06:49] cupantae: yes, $( ) is a totally different context, you can do;  echo "$( echo "$(echo "foo")")"
2015-07-11 10:47:22	zxd1	[10:07:14] what is $"foo bar"   used for
2015-07-11 10:47:22	pgas	[10:07:24] !$"
2015-07-11 10:47:22	greybot	[10:07:24] Bash supports $"..." quoting syntax for locale-specific translation. If the current locale is C or POSIX, the dollar sign is ignored. If the string is translated and replaced, the replacement is double-quoted. See http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/098

2015-07-11 10:47:22	everym4n	[10:33:02] what's the right/fast way to create file with 1 000 000 of zeros(not null)?
2015-07-11 10:47:22	pgas	[10:33:49] hmm, what do you mean 0(not null) ? the ascii char 0?
2015-07-11 10:47:22	izabera	[10:33:49] dd bs=1000 count=1000 < /dev/zero | tr '\0' 0 > file

2015-07-11 13:07:42	Groggle	[11:36:50] I did a module on it in college but have long since forgotten everything about it.

2015-07-11 13:07:42	Nomenclatura	[12:03:28] question. I want to merge two binaries but I want to have 1 bit from this and 1 bit from the next. Not a "cat >>"
2015-07-11 13:07:42	Nomenclatura	[12:03:47] no idea how to have singular bits selected :S
2015-07-11 13:07:42	izabera	[12:04:31] why
2015-07-11 13:07:42	herpoderp	[12:05:02] what the....
2015-07-11 13:07:42	Nomenclatura	[12:14:26] there is "head" but it handles bytes, no bits
2015-07-11 13:07:42	izabera	[12:15:22] are you trying to perform some kind of steganography or what?
2015-07-11 13:07:42	bekks	[12:15:43] Security by obscurity. :)
2015-07-11 13:07:42	zacts	[12:16:15] obscurity by "security"
2015-07-11 13:07:42	zacts	[12:16:26] security by obscurity iff obscurity by "security"
2015-07-11 13:07:42	zacts	[12:16:31] ^ the quotes are important there
2015-07-11 13:07:42	Nomenclatura	[12:16:38] yes :3
2015-07-11 13:07:42	izabera	[12:17:00] ok, let's start by saying that bash is definitely not the right tool
2015-07-11 13:07:42	izabera	[12:17:29] that said, it should be relatively easy but it'll be _very_ slow
2015-07-11 13:07:42	Nomenclatura	[12:18:49] hah yes I know
2015-07-11 13:07:42	Nomenclatura	[12:19:47] I guess everything is easy once you know how... the only thing I rly dunno how to is how to select bits
2015-07-11 13:07:42	Nomenclatura	[12:19:56] the rest I can figure out
2015-07-11 13:07:42	kurahaupo_	[12:22:10] Nomenclatura: make a  256x256 lookup table, and index it by pairs of bytes
2015-07-11 13:07:42	izabera	[12:22:25] something like this?    http://arin.ga/ma3WjQ/raw
2015-07-11 13:07:42	izabera	[12:23:04] make sure that file1 and file2 are the same size
2015-07-11 13:07:42	izabera	[12:23:15] no wait that's wrong
2015-07-11 13:07:42	izabera	[12:23:24] it only prints half the bits
2015-07-11 13:07:42	Nomenclatura	[12:24:56] actually files are streams kurahaupo_ :S
2015-07-11 13:07:42	Nomenclatura	[12:25:15] but I get it :)
2015-07-11 13:07:42	daspence	[12:33:52] how would I unmount more than 1 drive at once?
2015-07-11 13:07:42	Nomenclatura	[12:36:37] lol it worked
2015-07-11 13:07:42	Nomenclatura	[12:36:48] too well actually
2015-07-11 13:07:42	Nomenclatura	[12:37:07] so well it crashed me
2015-07-11 13:07:42	Nomenclatura	[12:37:17] Thanks for the idea :)
2015-07-11 13:07:42	kurahaupo_	[12:40:24] daspence: does your umount command take multiple paths?
2015-07-11 13:07:42	daspence	[12:40:49] yes it does

2015-07-11 13:07:42	mathys1	[12:51:40] hi guys I have a log file and if I find a keywords in that file I will catch the timestamp before of this keywords, how can do this in bash?
2015-07-11 13:07:42	izabera	[12:52:43] the timestamp from the line above?
2015-07-11 13:07:42	izabera	[12:52:59] or the same line?
2015-07-11 13:07:42	mathys1	[12:55:02] from the lines before
2015-07-11 13:07:42	mathys1	[12:55:15] for example I will have something like that:
2015-07-11 13:07:42	mathys1	[12:55:21] TIMESTAMP = 12131223232;
2015-07-11 13:07:42	mathys1	[12:55:26] command1;
2015-07-11 13:07:42	mathys1	[12:55:34] command2 etc etc
2015-07-11 13:07:42	mathys1	[12:55:38] keyword
2015-07-11 13:07:42	mathys1	[12:55:52] when I will find the keyword I need to catch up the TIMESTAMP before
2015-07-11 13:07:42	mathys1	[12:57:55] is it clear my issue?
2015-07-11 13:07:42	mathys1	[12:57:56] :)
2015-07-11 13:07:42	mathys1	[12:58:06] I hope is possible to do with bash
2015-07-11 13:07:42	mathys1	[13:03:59] ?
2015-07-11 13:07:42	geirha	[13:05:51] awk '/TIMESTAMP = /{timestamp=$3} /keyword/ { print "found keyword under timestamp:", timestamp }'
2015-07-11 13:07:42	geirha	[13:07:01] maybe timestamp=$3+0 to get rid of the ; too
