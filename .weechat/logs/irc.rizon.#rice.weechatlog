2015-07-11 13:07:43	array	[12:55:21] after i tried to kill myself and stayed in the hospital for a while
2015-07-11 13:07:43	array	[12:55:26] my parents came for me
2015-07-11 13:07:43	oedla	[12:55:37] killing yourself is bad, m8
2015-07-11 13:07:43	array	[12:55:38] im 23 and once again... im at my parents
2015-07-11 13:07:43	array	[12:56:07] well yeah. it didnt seem like a bad idea at the time
2015-07-11 13:07:43	array	[12:56:14] i wouldve just fallen asleep
2015-07-11 13:07:43	array	[12:56:22] but i didnt take enough
2015-07-11 13:07:43	array	[12:56:25] :P
2015-07-11 13:07:43	oedla	[12:56:56] iktf tbh, tried once when I was 17, but the thing I hung the noose from broke due to my immense fatness (both a contributing factor to why I did it and also what saved me. I find it very funny now, in retrospect)
2015-07-11 13:07:43	array	[12:57:13] the irony
2015-07-11 13:07:43	oedla	[12:57:16] indeed
2015-07-11 13:07:43	array	[12:57:20] well
2015-07-11 13:07:43	array	[12:57:26] i couldnt live with the shame anymore
2015-07-11 13:07:43	bixxx	[12:57:27] damn
2015-07-11 13:07:43	bixxx	[12:57:33] this is like that movie
2015-07-11 13:07:43	bixxx	[12:57:39] where the guy kept trying to kill himself
2015-07-11 13:07:43	array	[12:57:42] of constantly being a failure
2015-07-11 13:07:43	bixxx	[12:58:07] "i tried OD'ing, but i threw everything up. I tried hanging myself, but my legs hit the ground and the rope snapped"
2015-07-11 13:07:43	oedla	[12:59:35] I tied the rope onto one of those hooks you hang lamps from, should have known of course that it couldn't support much weight, but my intent was true so I still count it as an attempt
2015-07-11 13:07:43	oedla	[12:59:58] got me to get help and get fit though, so that's good
2015-07-11 13:07:43	oedla	[13:00:09] this was 15 years ago though so now I'm fat again lmao
2015-07-11 13:07:43	oedla	[13:01:10] wait, no... 11 years ago
2015-07-11 13:07:43	bixxx	[13:04:02] i wish i was 11 years younger
2015-07-11 13:07:43	bixxx	[13:04:30] i would've just finished my first year of highschool
2015-07-11 13:07:43	oedla	[13:05:09] lots of things would be done differently, that's for sure
2015-07-11 13:07:43	bixxx	[13:05:21] yea
2015-07-11 13:07:43	oedla	[13:05:25] I would never have gone into IT for a career for one, fml tbh
2015-07-11 13:07:43	oedla	[13:06:27] it's fun for a hobby etc, but it's tedious as fuck for work... or maybe I've just been unfortunate in postings
