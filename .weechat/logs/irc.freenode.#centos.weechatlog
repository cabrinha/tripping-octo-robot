2015-07-11 10:47:22	chipotle	[09:32:28] hi, has anybody built their own NAS from CentOS? I am coming from debian/ubuntu and want to learn CentOS as i work with fortune 500 clients now and i have a 6x3tb freeNAS box, but i'm sick and tired of freenas. so i backed everything up and moved it to another server and now i want to try to roll my own centOS nas distro. i was wondering if anybody had advice for someone coming from deb
2015-07-11 10:47:22	Sokel	[09:37:38] chipotle: Depends on what you want to do. FreeNAS is exactly what it's meant for. If you're trying to use CentOS for a NAS, it is possible, just know it may require additional setup and configuration. There's pros and cons to what you want to do.
2015-07-11 10:47:22	Sokel	[09:37:53] You should do some of your own testing to draw a conclusion.
2015-07-11 10:47:22	chipotle	[09:38:06] Sokel: i am planning on having a GUI just in case my main computer (laptop) needs service or something, plus i want to run plex server to my raspberry pi plex client app.
2015-07-11 10:47:22	chipotle	[09:38:19] but 90% of the time it will be used as a pure file server and plex engine
2015-07-11 10:47:22	chipotle	[09:38:31] maybe i'll do some web browsing on it for some reason
2015-07-11 10:47:22	chipotle	[09:39:03] i want to use smb/afp (which will be dead soon) and nfs, have access via sftp and ssh for remote ownCloud service (dropbox replacement on your own hardware)
2015-07-11 10:47:22	Sokel	[09:39:18] Right. So all I did was stand up a CentOS machine with RAID1 on a start up disks, RAID 5 (over 5 drives). I did hardware RAID, but you could do LVM software raid too.
2015-07-11 10:47:22	chipotle	[09:39:23] freeNAS is buggy as hell and i don't have time to learn a new operating system that i'll never use again
2015-07-11 10:47:22	chipotle	[09:39:48] i was planning on using LVM and raid 5 as i have a dedicated backup server too to make snapshots, no reason for 2 disk redundancy imho
2015-07-11 10:47:22	Sokel	[09:40:07] It's all on your use case.
2015-07-11 10:47:22	eb0t	[10:23:18] hey anyone know why when i overrun the line on a command ....the cursor goes to the beginnng of the line and starts to overwrite the prompt
2015-07-11 10:47:22	eb0t	[10:23:59] it still works but it looks like its broken
2015-07-11 10:47:22	dgbaley	[10:42:58] eb0t: usually this means your terminal emulator is out of sync with how many columns are available to it. A fix is to resize the window a bit... are you in a GUI environment?

2015-07-11 14:58:34	Zerberus	verify as what user the redis service should be running and make sure the /var/log/redis directory is writable for that user
2015-07-11 14:58:36	TommyC	If it's not executable you can't cd to the dir.
2015-07-11 15:02:21	theskillwithin	I can't seem to find a way on google to do that, but what I do know is my ssh user is vagrant

2015-07-11 15:06:55	centbot	An excellent guide for new users can be found here: http://linux.2038bug.com/rute-home.html While not official documentation, it contains information that should help you out.
2015-07-11 15:07:02	theskillwithin	then I took the 2nd linux class, and I dropped out of that one =\
2015-07-11 15:07:17	@TrevorH	I think you should have persevered
2015-07-11 15:07:36	TommyC	I'm a Uni. student myself, but I've never taken a Linux class.
2015-07-11 15:07:37	theskillwithin	it was the type of class where if u missed 1 class, then ur screwed

2015-07-11 15:14:05	theskillwithin	Well I am starting to use vagrant instead of running a server on my mac when developing Magento sites.  and now I'm finding its awesome because it matches hosts environment, but also difficult for the same reason.
2015-07-11 15:16:11	theskillwithin	I actually caught a problem with the server when they gave us a new one because I was running centos vm
