2015-07-11 10:47:22	dewp	[09:35:22] thats what you said with your attributes - what do you want to achieve?
2015-07-11 10:47:22	dewp	[09:36:21] if you want a stick footer you'll find lots of code snippets via google
2015-07-11 10:47:22	thecoolguy	[09:36:56] i'm trying to understand what i'm doing wrong
2015-07-11 10:47:22	thecoolguy	[09:37:54] if i remove position:abosolute it stays at the bottom but it is not always at the bottom of the page
2015-07-11 10:47:22	thecoolguy	[09:41:14] This is what i have http://jsfiddle.net/vvb2xxte/1/
2015-07-11 10:47:22	thecoolguy	[09:44:19] dewp ?
2015-07-11 10:47:22	dewp	[09:51:58] not sure what you want

2015-07-11 10:47:22	thecoolguy	[10:03:55] ugh
2015-07-11 10:47:22	thecoolguy	[10:04:05] the problem was i needed to set the height of container to 100%
2015-07-11 10:47:22	thecoolguy	[10:04:07] :/
2015-07-11 10:47:22	thecoolguy	[10:05:16] ugh
2015-07-11 10:47:22	thecoolguy	[10:05:21] now that has side effects

2015-07-11 10:47:22	thecoolguy	[10:23:52] How would i have my footer be at the bottom ?

2015-07-11 10:47:22	thecoolguy	[10:26:18] yes Squarepy
2015-07-11 10:47:22	Squarepy	[10:27:41] bottom of what, the screen? or the page?
2015-07-11 10:47:22	Squarepy	[10:28:09] you'll have to fill a viewport first to define a bottom
2015-07-11 10:47:22	Squarepy	[10:28:28] if you want bottom page = bottom screen, than height has to be set
2015-07-11 10:47:22	thecoolguy	[10:29:20] bottom of page and bottom of screen when at bottom of page
2015-07-11 10:47:22	thecoolguy	[10:30:58] Well Squarepy
2015-07-11 10:47:22	Squarepy	[10:31:48] well what, you taking minimal effort to explain yourself and I have minimal effort to understand it :)
2015-07-11 10:47:22	thecoolguy	[10:32:33] sorry didn't mean it like that lol i was trying to formulate what is going wrong
2015-07-11 10:47:22	thecoolguy	[10:32:45] to type
2015-07-11 10:47:22	thecoolguy	[10:36:03] ah i see

2015-07-11 10:47:22	thecoolguy	[10:37:01] i was getting vertical scroll when i did height = 100% but i see that i can't have body be relative i had to wrap my bootstrap container in a div and make the div relative and my footer absolute
2015-07-11 10:47:22	thecoolguy	[10:37:04] ugh xx
2015-07-11 10:47:22	thecoolguy	[10:39:51] wait nope xx

2015-07-11 10:47:22	Squarepy	[10:44:35] that is just a fiddle artifact is my guess
2015-07-11 10:47:22	thecoolguy	[10:45:06] it isn't because i'm having the same problem on my site

2015-07-11 13:07:43	thecoolguy	[11:46:10] because i've raninto occasions where my footoer goes up the page slightly to far but i'm not sure why
2015-07-11 13:07:43	thecoolguy	[11:46:25] is it only block elements that contrute or something ?
2015-07-11 13:07:43	b4b	[11:47:59] I think it’s the width/height of any static position element
2015-07-11 13:07:43	thecoolguy	[11:49:07] does it also account for the margins of those elements
2015-07-11 13:07:43	b4b	[11:49:24] yes i believe so
2015-07-11 13:07:43	thecoolguy	[11:49:27] i'm wondering if maybe it happens because i use margin when i should be using padding ?
2015-07-11 13:07:43	b4b	[11:50:42] I would setup a few test cases, they would give you definitive answers
2015-07-11 13:07:43	thecoolguy	[11:51:02] man csss can be fustrating
2015-07-11 13:07:43	b4b	[11:51:17] no doubt
2015-07-11 13:07:43	thecoolguy	[11:51:27] i spent like 4 hours trying to figure out why my footer was riding so far up my page
2015-07-11 13:07:43	thecoolguy	[11:51:58] ended up just wrapping everything and adding padding to that div whichfixed it
2015-07-11 13:07:43	thecoolguy	[11:52:22] 4 hours to figure out 1 line :(
2015-07-11 13:07:43	thecoolguy	[11:53:06] I'm betting if i was to go back and replace my margin code with padding so the sizes are altered it would work without me having to add padding and wrappingit again but ugh iwill prob test that when i refactor
2015-07-11 13:07:43	b4b	[11:54:34] when it comes to css positioning nothing beats experimentation
2015-07-11 13:07:43	hackal	[12:17:22] Hello I am trying to select my first paragraph tag on site. but p:first-of-type selects first paragraphs with parents. Any other way to do it? Thank you
2015-07-11 13:07:43	boogyman	[12:19:10] body > p:first-of-type
2015-07-11 13:07:43	marrenarre	[12:19:25] boogyman: I don't think that works.
2015-07-11 13:07:43	marrenarre	[12:19:36] hackal: There is no general way to do it. The selector will need to be specific to your site.
2015-07-11 13:07:43	hackal	[12:20:09] body > p would work only if p is direct child.
2015-07-11 13:07:43	hackal	[12:20:25] ok, so no general way
2015-07-11 13:07:43	marrenarre	[12:20:30] And only if the first p is a direct child.
2015-07-11 13:07:43	marrenarre	[12:20:47] hackal: Link to site?
2015-07-11 13:07:43	marrenarre	[12:20:56] I have to go, though, so someone else will have to help.
2015-07-11 13:07:43	hackal	[12:21:24] I have no site, I just need to find a way to select first element
2015-07-11 13:07:43	boogyman	[12:21:51] marrenarre: http://jsbin.com/girocegoto/edit?html,css,output seems to work fine for me
2015-07-11 13:07:43	b4b	[12:23:04] is there a media query for touchscreen ?
2015-07-11 13:07:43	marrenarre	[12:23:27] boogyman: Really?: http://jsbin.com/rehoyuzece/1/edit?html,css,output
2015-07-11 13:07:43	boogyman	[12:23:31] b4b: there aren't "named" breakpoints
2015-07-11 13:07:43	marrenarre	[12:23:47] boogyman: I think he meant something like @media touch, but I could be wrong.
2015-07-11 13:07:43	marrenarre	[12:24:03] (And I don't think it exists, if that is what he meant.)
2015-07-11 13:07:43	marrenarre	[12:24:32] I will go now.
2015-07-11 13:07:43	 *	marrenarre [12:24:38] will be back later. ---
2015-07-11 13:07:43	Alexendoo	[12:24:42] There are some vendor prefixed ones but *shrug*
2015-07-11 13:07:43	b4b	[12:25:01] marrenarre: is correct
2015-07-11 13:07:43	Alexendoo	[12:25:28] Better to just go by size really
2015-07-11 13:07:43	b4b	[12:59:11] :not(.selectfields) .sizer does this mean any class of sizer that is not a child of .selectfields?
2015-07-11 13:07:43	marrenarre	[13:01:10] b4b: It means any .sizer that is a child of something that is not .selectfields.
2015-07-11 13:07:43	b4b	[13:01:51] weird doesnt seem to be working
2015-07-11 13:07:43	marrenarre	[13:02:11] b4b: Testcase?
2015-07-11 13:07:43	b4b	[13:02:30] does depth level matter?
2015-07-11 13:07:43	arup_r	[13:02:47] the lock should be beside the billing address text .. but it went up.. how to fix it using CSS ? https://gist.github.com/aruprakshit/f84f7bd207a34378d930
2015-07-11 13:07:43	b4b	[13:02:53] like .selectfields div div div div .sizer?
2015-07-11 13:07:43	arup_r	[13:02:56] I am using bootstrap3
2015-07-11 13:07:43	marrenarre	[13:02:57] The only requirement is that it has one parent (as far as I know).
2015-07-11 13:07:43	arup_r	[13:03:07] and https://fezvrasta.github.io/bootstrap-material-design/#button
2015-07-11 13:07:43	marrenarre	[13:03:36] b4b: If an elemnt is targeted by that selector, it will not be targeted by the first selector that you wrote.
2015-07-11 13:07:43	b4b	[13:05:16] f it i’ll just write it the oppisite way
2015-07-11 13:07:43	marrenarre	[13:05:29] `live @ b4b
2015-07-11 13:07:43	Selvvir	[13:05:29] b4b, Always provide a link to a *live* page or pared-down testcase so we can see the problem in action. Looking at code or images alone usually isn't very effective. Also see `paste and `testcase.
2015-07-11 13:07:43	arup_r	[13:06:51] any hints to me to fix ?
