2015-07-11 10:53:28	fenrus02	nvidia's .run file breaks 3d libs. removing that blob is non-trivial at best, and does involve reinstalling several packages.  really consider using the properly packaged items on rpmfusion instead.
2015-07-11 10:53:54	fenrus02	from your error, you decided to use the .run file ..  best of luck to you.

2015-07-11 13:07:43	ikonia	[12:57:40] part of this will probably be due to a.) you're using grub4dos b) puppy's save file running
2015-07-11 13:07:43	ibouvousaime	[12:57:42] the grub4dos config worked with a corrupt ISO of fedora
2015-07-11 13:07:43	ibouvousaime	[12:57:48] before
2015-07-11 13:07:43	ikonia	[12:57:49] I suggest you take this to #puppylinux - it's not a fedora problem
2015-07-11 13:07:43	ikonia	[12:57:56] you've got a very non-standard setup
2015-07-11 13:07:43	ibouvousaime	[12:58:01] Im asking there
2015-07-11 13:07:43	ikonia	[12:58:24] right, so this isn't a fedora problem
2015-07-11 13:07:43	M4ca-net	[12:58:52] Hello. I have an issue while upgrading my system. Trough terminal, with dnf command, it tell me "Error: Transaction check error" and a huge list... How can I solve this?? Thanks

2015-07-11 13:07:43	randomuser	[12:59:26] M4ca-net, do a `dnf clean all` and try again, if it persists, share the entire output
2015-07-11 13:07:43	ibouvousaime	[12:59:40] It is a fedora problem because the configuration of grub4dos worked with a different Fedora ISO which was corrupt, only the fedora guys knopw how to setup stuff that make their OS boot ikonia
2015-07-11 13:07:43	ikonia	[12:59:45] ibouvousaime: it's not a fedora problem
2015-07-11 13:07:43	M4ca-net	[12:59:48] ok randomuser, thank you, I'm going to do it now
2015-07-11 13:07:43	hpmozzy	[13:01:01] dnf clean all worked wonders when half my updates were "stuck"
2015-07-11 13:07:43	ibouvousaime	[13:01:32] I insist its a fedora problem only fedora guys know how to setup a bootloader to make run their OS
2015-07-11 13:07:43	ibouvousaime	[13:01:40] the bootloader
2015-07-11 13:07:43	ikonia	[13:01:41] Error 60: File for drive emulation must be in one  contiguous disk area
2015-07-11 13:07:43	ibouvousaime	[13:01:42] worked
2015-07-11 13:07:43	ibouvousaime	[13:01:46] with a different iso
2015-07-11 13:07:43	ikonia	[13:01:47] that is hte hypervisor
2015-07-11 13:07:43	ikonia	[13:01:50] that is not the ISO
2015-07-11 13:07:43	ikonia	[13:02:13] grub4dos is NOT the fedora boot loader
2015-07-11 13:07:43	ikonia	[13:02:16] so this is your bootloader + your puppy hypervisor setup
2015-07-11 13:07:43	ikonia	[13:02:18] not the fedora ISO
2015-07-11 13:07:43	ibouvousaime	[13:02:19] Why did it work with a different fedora ISO then ?
2015-07-11 13:07:43	randomuser	[13:02:31] we don't know how it works or doesn't, it isn't a fedora thing
2015-07-11 13:07:43	ikonia	[13:02:47] ibouvousaime: different ISO's will have different requirements
2015-07-11 13:07:43	ikonia	[13:03:13] ibouvousaime: again - work it through with the puppy guys, the safe file format will be a factor, as wil grub4dos
2015-07-11 13:07:43	randomuser	[13:03:20] BUT - you're using legacy grub to try booting UEFI-capable hybrid media
2015-07-11 13:07:43	randomuser	[13:03:43] at least, I think it's legacy grub
2015-07-11 13:07:43	ikonia	[13:03:45] it's not
2015-07-11 13:07:43	ikonia	[13:03:55] it's a bastard grub build for dos based file systems
2015-07-11 13:07:43	ikonia	[13:03:58] hence grub4dos
2015-07-11 13:07:43	randomuser	[13:04:06] ah
2015-07-11 13:07:43	ikonia	[13:04:14] it causes problems in general, puppy uses it for soe situations due to the save file "virtual booting" it uses
2015-07-11 13:07:43	ikonia	[13:04:20] hence why I'm guiding him where to look
2015-07-11 13:07:43	randomuser	[13:04:46] ibouvousaime, try http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/alt/bfo/bfo.usb
2015-07-11 13:07:43	randomuser	[13:04:58] dd it to your USB drive
2015-07-11 13:07:43	ibouvousaime	[13:05:32] okay
2015-07-11 13:07:43	ikonia	[13:05:49] I suspect you will find that will fail also

2015-07-11 13:07:43	ibouvousaime	[13:06:21] What does that do ?
2015-07-11 13:07:43	randomuser	[13:06:29] I don't know about the puppy hypervisor situation, but avoiding it should work predictably
2015-07-11 13:07:43	ikonia	[13:06:35] it's not a good setup
2015-07-11 13:07:43	ikonia	[13:06:46] as it's a "virtual OS" running from a swapped out "safe file" setup
2015-07-11 13:07:43	M4ca-net	[13:07:03] randomuser the error persisted, the error transaction
2015-07-11 13:07:43	ikonia	[13:07:13] too much of it isn't designed to work with normal (or what most people would consider normal) operations
