2015-07-11 14:44:25	fields_	hi everyone - I’m having a hard time with environment variables. Is every environment variable set in bash from where I invoke brew available to the makefile called from within the homebrew recipe?
2015-07-11 14:46:43	mistym	fields_: No - Homebrew sanitizes the build environment, so most variables that commonly influence the build are controlled by Homebrew.

2015-07-11 14:48:10	fields_	thanks, that explains a lot; what’s the recommended way for me to make the required ones available?
2015-07-11 14:48:22	mistym	What are you trying to do?
2015-07-11 14:50:27	fields_	The makefile runs a custom 3rd party script whose path is specified by an environment variable, which was set by sourcing a .sh script file prior to invoking brew.
2015-07-11 14:51:18	mistym	Can you set up that script inside Homebrew? e.g., don't require the user to have run it outside it, but download and run the script inside the install method?
2015-07-11 14:52:05	fields_	That’d be ideal, but I don’t think source can be invoked from ruby, right?
2015-07-11 14:53:12	mistym	It wouldn't have the desired effect, no. But if you need just one path, can you just set the path to the script inside the buildscript rather than sourcing it?
2015-07-11 14:53:45	mistym	I need to run to do some errands, but I'll be back in a little bit.
2015-07-11 14:53:55	fields_	thanks for the help!!
