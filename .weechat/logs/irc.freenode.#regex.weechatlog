2015-07-11 13:07:43	Mycelin	[12:04:22] hooray
2015-07-11 13:07:43	jim87	[12:05:35] even simplier: https://regex101.com/r/rZ7jW8/2 (deleted last \/?, as it's already at the end) /^list(?:\/(\d+)(?:\/(\d+))?)?[\/]?$/
2015-07-11 13:07:43	jim87	[12:06:11] i.e. "minumum model": (?:\/(\d+)) right?
2015-07-11 13:07:43	madprops	[12:41:32] Mateon1 looks perfect now i have to find a way to replace that in javascript
2015-07-11 13:07:43	+Mateon1	[12:43:20] madprops: Did you look at the code generator button on the side?
2015-07-11 13:07:43	+Mateon1	[12:43:42] It's string.replace(regex, substitution)
2015-07-11 13:07:43	madprops	[12:44:30] oh i didn't see that
2015-07-11 13:07:43	madprops	[12:46:46] madprops, hmm but how can I use what it matched inside the substitution
2015-07-11 13:07:43	madprops	[12:46:53] i mean Mateon1 
2015-07-11 13:07:43	madprops	[12:48:23] i'll check some old code where i think ive done this
2015-07-11 13:07:43	+Mateon1	[12:49:46] Hm, you can do: str.replace(regex, function (match, index, string) {/* access match */; return "<div> " + match + " </div>"; })
2015-07-11 13:07:43	+Mateon1	[12:49:49] madprops: 
2015-07-11 13:07:43	madprops	[12:50:17] i see
2015-07-11 13:07:43	madprops	[12:50:20] i also found this var n = str.replace(/#[\w.-]+/g, "<b>$&</b>");
2015-07-11 13:07:43	madprops	[12:50:37] looks less flexible but enough for what i have to do
2015-07-11 13:07:43	+Mateon1	[12:51:01] There are special $ codes in Javascrupt substitution, I'll look it up on MDN
2015-07-11 13:07:43	+Mateon1	[12:52:13] Oh, interesting. Maybe \0 and $0 don't work in Javascript substitution
2015-07-11 13:07:43	+Mateon1	[12:52:26] You can always place a capturing group around it and use $1
2015-07-11 13:07:43	madprops	[12:54:08] Mateon1, i have one small problem
2015-07-11 13:07:43	madprops	[12:54:20] you see what im trying to do is a poor man's text to url converter
2015-07-11 13:07:43	madprops	[12:54:31] so i thought most things that had a dot like that would be urls
2015-07-11 13:07:43	madprops	[12:54:35] likke google.com
2015-07-11 13:07:43	madprops	[12:54:45] but that regex only captures part of the whole 'word'
2015-07-11 13:07:43	madprops	[12:54:52] i need to capture all of https://www.reddit.com/r/cringe/comments/3cscvd/guy_pulled_on_stage_to_play_at_steel_panther/
2015-07-11 13:07:43	madprops	[12:54:54] for example
2015-07-11 13:07:43	+Mateon1	[12:55:08] Well... That's a more difficult thing to pull off
2015-07-11 13:07:43	madprops	[12:55:17] hmm
2015-07-11 13:07:43	+Mateon1	[12:55:20] I'd look for a list of reserved TLDs
2015-07-11 13:07:43	madprops	[12:55:44] i just wanted to work on the premise that if it had a dot in between it was a url
2015-07-11 13:07:43	madprops	[12:56:03] i could just use some libs that do this but it seems overkill, they're too big
2015-07-11 13:07:43	+Mateon1	[12:56:20] Might try /.+\.\w{2,}\.+/g
2015-07-11 13:07:43	+Mateon1	[12:56:39] Lets stuff that isn't URLs through, but works
2015-07-11 13:07:43	+Mateon1	[12:57:21] If you want to only allow valid URLs you should look for a URL parser
2015-07-11 13:07:43	+Mateon1	[12:57:36] There exist libraries that allow you to parse URLs easily
2015-07-11 13:07:43	madprops	[12:57:55] i just thought like, people dont usually.write like this
2015-07-11 13:07:43	madprops	[12:58:13] so if there's a . between characters it would _usually_ be a valid url
2015-07-11 13:07:43	+Mateon1	[12:58:39] I'd look for a list of TLDs for that, hold on a second
2015-07-11 13:07:43	madprops	[12:58:53] nah man, that's too much work
2015-07-11 13:07:43	+Mateon1	[12:59:05] No, it will be a big regex, but won't be hard
2015-07-11 13:07:43	madprops	[12:59:17] for some reason return msg.replace(/.+\.\w{2,}\.+/g, '<a class="chat_link" target="_blank" href="$&"> $& </a>');
2015-07-11 13:07:43	madprops	[12:59:21] that isn't working properly
2015-07-11 13:07:43	madprops	[12:59:24] it returns the regex string
2015-07-11 13:07:43	+Mateon1	[13:01:14] Oh god this is an XSS disaster waiting to happen. Alright, seems like you don't want quotes and spaces... Try /[^\s"]+\.\w{2,}[^\s"]*/g
2015-07-11 13:07:43	+Mateon1	[13:01:27] Also, you should not allow backslashes
2015-07-11 13:07:43	+Mateon1	[13:01:33] Oh god this is an XSS disaster waiting to happen. Alright, seems like you don't want quotes and spaces... Try /[^\s"\\]+\.\w{2,}[^\s"\\]*/g
2015-07-11 13:07:43	+Mateon1	[13:01:41] Oops, posted the whole message again
2015-07-11 13:07:43	+Mateon1	[13:01:49] Wanted to only post the regex again
2015-07-11 13:07:43	madprops	[13:01:54] lol
2015-07-11 13:07:43	madprops	[13:04:11] dude it works perfectly
2015-07-11 13:07:43	+Mateon1	[13:07:18] madprops: https://regex101.com/r/bU3wM4/1 This regex has all the current existing TLDs. Matches relatively well
